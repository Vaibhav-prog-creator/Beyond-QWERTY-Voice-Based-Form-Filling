# Voice-Based Form Filling Application

## Overview
This project is a **Voice-Based Form Filling Application** that allows users to fill out forms using their voice. It leverages the **Web Speech API** for speech recognition, enabling users to interact with the form without needing to type. This is particularly useful for people with disabilities, for hands-free form filling, or for enhancing the user experience with voice-activated controls.

## Features
- **Voice Input**: Users can fill out the form by speaking instead of typing.
- **Web Speech API**: Utilizes the Web Speech API for converting speech to text in real-time.
- **Advanced UI**: The form has a clean, user-friendly interface designed with modern web technologies.
- **Multi-field Form**: Collects data such as Name, Email, Phone, Age, Education, and Course.
- **Flask Backend**: The backend is built using **Flask**, a lightweight Python web framework, which handles form submissions and data storage.
- **MySQL Database**: Data is stored in a MySQL database, ensuring persistence and easy access.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Web Speech API**: For speech-to-text functionality
